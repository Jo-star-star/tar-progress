# tar-progress

This program was developped to get easyly a progress bar during the tar compression or extraction.

This program can be launched on these plateforms:
    - Linux
    - Windows
Warning: On Windows i used the tarfile module from Python wich is very slow. I'm open to suggest about this performance problem

I'm currently working to finish the windows adaptation, which is present in my local branch.

I hope my script will be usefull for you.

The command is simple: 
    
`tar-progress -cjf myArchive.tar.bz2 myfiles0`
